Task 1: Image Classification using CNN

Question: Build a CNN model to classify the dataset images into their respective categories.
Approach:

  * Preprocessed the dataset with normalization and resizing.
  * Designed a CNN with convolution, pooling, flatten, and dense layers.
  * Used activation functions (ReLU, softmax) and dropout for regularization.
Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.
Dataset: Standard dataset provided (train, validation, test split).
Sample & Test Data: Around 80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing.
Results: Achieved approximately 0.67 test accuracy.

Task 2: NLP - Text Classification

Question: Develop a model to classify text documents into their categories.
Approach:

  * Cleaned and preprocessed text (tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal).
  * Converted text into numerical form using embeddings.
  * Built a sequential model with Embedding, LSTM layers, and Dense output.
Libraries Used: TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK, NumPy, Pandas.
Dataset: Text dataset with labeled categories.
Sample & Test Data: Training and testing split to evaluate generalization.
Results: Achieved a reasonable classification accuracy (value from experiment).

 
 Task 3: Regression with Deep Learning

Question: Predict continuous values (e.g., house prices, stock values) using deep learning regression.
Approach:

  * Preprocessed numerical dataset with normalization.
  * Built a sequential deep learning regression model with dense layers.
  * Used MSE/MAE as loss functions.
  * 
Libraries Used: TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
Dataset: Tabular dataset with input features and continuous target.
Sample & Test Data: Divided into training, validation, and test sets.
Results: Model provided reasonable regression predictions (with acceptable loss/MAE).
